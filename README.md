# responsiveportfolio
For this assignment the goal was to make an active portfolio with an about me page and a contact page. The idea behind the aesthetic I chose was just minimalistic. I plan to add color to it in the future by utilizing the project cards on the front page. Initially on my contact page I wanted to add a submission form but I was unable to figure out how to have it function. I ended up creating links to contact me instead. My plans for the about me page are to include more information of what i've learned during my time with rutgers coding bootcamp as well as new skills that i continue to learn. You can find my portfolio at https://hvrclls.github.io/.
